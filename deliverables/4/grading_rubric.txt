Autograder (75%):

You need to find THREE methods that are intentionally implemented in
a way to be grossly slow, that take up most of the CPU time.

Performance tests:                                        _____ / 45
  * -15 for each slow method.

My pinning tests:                                         _____ / 15
  * -5 for each failing pinning test.

Your pinning tests (GameOfLifePinningTest):               _____ / 15
  * -5 for each failing pinning test.

Your pinning tests are written correctly (15%):

Each of the tests are commented properly:                 _____ / 5
  * Please follow the format we used for Deliverable 2: preconditions,
    execution steps, and postconditions.

External objects are mocked appropriately:                _____ / 5
  * Each pinning test should be localized; code for external classes should
    not be exercised as part of the test.

Behavior verification is used appropriately:              _____ / 5
  * One of the pinning test requires behavior verification; it returns void
    and does not change any visible state.  You need to use behavior
    verification for this method.
