## App homepage: https://cs1632.appspot.com/

FUN-WELCOME - The homepage shall display the quote "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.", and below it the author "- Brian W. Kernighan".  The title shall be "CS1632 D3".

FUN-LINKS - Every page shall include five links at the top, to "CS1632 D3 Home", "Factorial", "Fibonacci", "Hello", and "Cathedral Pics".  These shall link to `/`, `/fact`, `/fib`, `/hello`, and `/cathy`, respectively.

FUN-FACT - The factorial page (`/fact`) shall allow a user to enter a positive integer from 1 to 10, and upon pressing submit, shall show to the user the factorial of the value (e.g. "Factorial of 5 is 120!").

FUN-FIB - The Fibonacci page (`/fib`) shall allow a user to enter a positive integer from 1 to 10, and upon pressing submit, shall show to the user the Fibonnaci of the value (e.g. "Fibonacci of 5 is 5!").  Note that the Fibonnaci series is: f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 2, f(4) = 3, f(5) = 5, f(6) = 8, ...

FUN-INVALID-VALUE - For both the Fibonacci and Factorial pages, if a user enters an invalid string of any kind (any string other than integers from 1 to 10), they shall be informed that the value is 1 (e.g., "Fibonacci of -100 is 1!")

FUN-HELLO - Accessing the hello page (`/hello`) with no trailing values in the URL shall display the message "Hello CS1632, from Dr. Ahn!".

FUN-HELLO-TRAILING - If a trailing value is provided in the URL when accessing the `/hello` page, then the message shall display hello from that trailing value.  For example, when accessing `/hello/Jazzy`, the system shall display "Hello CS1632, from Jazzy!".  This shall work for all input values.

FUN-CATHY - The Cathedral page (`/cathy`) shall display exactly three images in a numbered list.
