Feature: Rent-A-Cat returning

As a user
I want to return a cat that I rented back to the rent-a-cat facility
So that I can be not accused of cat abduction.

Rule: When a cat is requested for return and the cat has not been rented,
the return is unsuccessful and the list of available cats remains the same.

Scenario: Attempt to return a cat that does not exist

Then the return is unsuccessful
When I list the cats
Then the listing is: "ID 1. Jennyanydots\nID 2. Old Deuteronomy\nID 3. Mistoffelees\n"
